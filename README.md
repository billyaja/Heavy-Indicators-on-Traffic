# Heavy-Indicators-on-Traffic

This is a simple data analysis project about the westbound traffic on [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94). The goal of this project is to analyse data to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.
